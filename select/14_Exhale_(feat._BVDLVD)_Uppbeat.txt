Fill my lungs with toxin
Inhale, Exhale
I feel so lethargic, creating my own hell
Fill my lungs with toxin
Inhale, Exhale
Weighing up my options
But they don't fit on the scales

Shawty got a body like a trophy
She say she love me but somehow I still feel lonely
I ain't got answers to my problems cus I'm lazy
I'm still on welfare cus this rap don't pay me, fuck
And I know that this shit going work out
I work everyday but feel like I don't work, how?
I make love to my self doubt
And strangle my confidence

On my own, on my own again
Can you fix my head?
Smash my phone so I don't call you again
Inhale, exhale
On my own, on my own again
Can you fix my head?
Smash my phone so I don't call you again
Inhale, еxhale

Don't wanna talk, don't wanna sleep
Don't wanna fuck, just wanna be
Sat therе with you focused on me, baby
Yeah
Hold tight to the ones that love me
Pray to god that my sins don't fuck me
Fucked up now I lost my buddy
And to my enemies watching, plotting
Just know I got a plan for you
I took care of the worst but I'm sat here looking back
At life with a mind full of fucked up views
I turn to drugs with no luck
But I'm still fucked up
So I can't refuse
Last week
Coughing fumes
Oh no, what I do!?

On my own, on my own again
Can you fix my head?
Smash my phone so I don't call you again
Inhale, exhale
On my own, on my own again
Can you fix my head?
Smash my phone so I don't call you again
Inhale, exhale

Fill my lungs with toxins
Inhale exhale
Weighing up my options
But they don't fit on the scales
